    "> To the pioneers such as Bernoulli, Bayes and Laplace, a probability represented a _degree-of-belief_ or plausibility; how much they thought that something was true, based on the evidence at hand. To the 19th century scholars, however, this seemed too vague and subjective an idea to be the basis of a rigorous mathematical theory. So they redefined probability as the _long-run relative frequency_ with which an event occurred, given (infinitely) many repeated (experimental) trials. Since frequencies can be measured, probability was now seen as an objective tool for dealing with _random_ phenomena.\n",

These are different enough cases to warrant special mention of this & two different names: the former is called a _probability mass function_ (PMF) and the latter a _probability distribution function_ (PDF). Time permitting, we may discuss some of the subtleties here. If not, all good texts will cover this. I like (Sivia & Skilling, 2006), among many others."
